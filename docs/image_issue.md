# Flutter Image Rendering Troubleshooting Guide

Since images are **not rendering on either web or Windows**, even with direct `Image.network` and public URLs, and you've already tried the minimal code and checked for CORS, here's a focused troubleshooting checklist and next steps:

---

## 1. **Minimal Standalone Test**

Please try this in a brand new Flutter project (not your main app):

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MaterialApp(
  home: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Test')),
    body: Center(
      child: Image.network(
        'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/PNG_transparency_demonstration_1.png',
        errorBuilder: (context, url, error) => Text('Error: $error'),
      ),
    ),
  ),
));
```
- Does this show the image on **Windows** and **web**?
- If not, the issue is with your Flutter install, system, or network.

---

## 2. **Check for Console/Terminal Errors**

- Run your app from the terminal and look for any error messages when the image tries to load.
- On web, open the browser console (F12) and look for CORS, SSL, or network errors.

---

## 3. **Check Your Network/Firewall/Proxy**

- Are you behind a corporate firewall, VPN, or proxy that could block image requests?
- Try running on a different network (e.g., mobile hotspot).

---

## 4. **Check Flutter Version and Dependencies**

- Run `flutter doctor` and ensure there are no issues.
- Make sure you are using a recent stable version of Flutter.

---

## 5. **Try a Local Asset Image**

- Add an image to your `assets/` folder and display it with `Image.asset('assets/your_image.png')`.
- If this works, the problem is definitely with network image loading.

---

## 6. **Try HTTP Instead of HTTPS (for test only)**

- Some environments block HTTPS or have SSL issues. Try a plain HTTP image (e.g., `http://placekitten.com/400/400`).

---

## 7. **Check for Adblockers/Extensions**

- On web, disable all browser extensions, especially adblockers and privacy tools.

---

## 8. **Try on a Different Machine**

- If possible, try running your app on a different computer.

---

## 9. **Check for Known Issues**

- There are rare bugs with `Image.network` on some Windows setups. See [Flutter GitHub issues](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+Image.network+windows).

---

## **Next Step**

**Please try the minimal standalone test above and let me know:**
- Does the image render in a new project?
- Any error messages in the console or terminal?

This will help us determine if the problem is with your environment or something specific in your app code.  
Let me know the results and we'll proceed from there!
